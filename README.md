This Power BI dashboard is a project I created using real-time-inspired data from Blinkit, a quick-commerce platform. It highlights key metrics such as Total Sales ($1.2M), Average Sales, Average Ratings, and Number of Ratings. The report includes detailed visuals on Fat Content, Sales by Item Types, Outlet Sizes, Establishment Year, and Sales by Location Tier
